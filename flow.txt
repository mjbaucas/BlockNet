Message Sending Flow:
1. Sender makes request to node
2. Request contains the message type, senders id, destination id
3. The node looks at the senders id
    a. look up the ledger for a corresponding public key
    b. decrypts the message with the public key
4. If the message can be decrypted
    a. Look up destination id and find corresponding public key
    b. Node checks if transaction with sender and destination allowed, through permissions or previous transactions
    c. Node replies to sender with public key of destination
5. Sender sends message (encrypted by public key of destination) to destination 
    a. Destination decrypts with private key
    b. Destination reads message

Authentication
1. Node gets the sender id
2. Checks the ledger if sender Id is registered to Node network
3. If not, no response
4. If registered, the message is processed
